# The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
This final project explores the best locations for Japanese restaurants throughout the city of New York. Potentially the owner of the new Japanese restaurant can have great success and consistent profit. However, as with any business, opening a new restaurant requires serious considerations and is more complicated than it seems from the first glance. In particular, the location of the restaurant is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will have success or a failure. So our project will attempt to answer the questions “Where should the investor open a Japanese Restaurant?” and “Where should I go If I want great Japanese food?”
